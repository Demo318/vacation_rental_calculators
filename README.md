# Vacation Rental Calculators

An application to provide Vacation Rental Management Companies insight into three revenue-generating strategies. The applicaitons provide users a calculator sandbox to run some of their own numbers as well as a long description of the strategy and how it might be implemented.

## The Calculators

### 1. Derivative Rates & Booking Fees

A method to mark-up rental rates for listings pushed to an Online Travel Agency (OTA). The additional revenue covers the OTA's fees and the remaining balance from the markup is netted into its own revenue account before the commission split with the property owner.

### 2. Dynamic Fees

Managers have the option to use length-of-stay or seasonality to charge higher fees, even though the cost of delivering the service associated with that fee remains constant.

### 3. Gap Night Logic

As bookings roll in, vacation-rental managers can acheive significantly more revenue by opening themselves up to shorter stays *after* they have exhausted every opportunity for their usual minimum-night-stay rules.
